# Time and Space Complexity

Time and Space Complexity help us **measure the efficiency of an algorithm**.

## Time Complexity

Time complexity describes how the **execution time grows** as input size increases.

Example:

* Searching an element in a list
* Sorting numbers
* Traversing a tree

## Space Complexity

Space complexity describes how much **extra memory** an algorithm uses.

This includes:

* Variables
* Data structures
* Recursive call stack

### Why complexity matters:

* Faster programs perform better
* Efficient memory usage prevents crashes
* Important for large-scale applications
