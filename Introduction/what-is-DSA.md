# What is Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)?

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the **foundation of problem-solving in computer science**.

* **Data Structures** define *how data is stored, organized, and accessed*.
* **Algorithms** define *the step-by-step process* to solve a problem efficiently using that data.

In simple words:

> **Data Structures = How data is arranged**
> **Algorithms = How problems are solved using that data**

### Why is DSA important?

* Helps solve problems efficiently
* Improves logical and analytical thinking
* Essential for technical interviews and competitive programming
* Makes code scalable and optimized

### Examples:

* Using an **array** to store student marks
* Using a **stack** for undo/redo operations
* Using **searching algorithms** to find data quickly
