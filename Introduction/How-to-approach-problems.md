# How to Approach a Problem in DSA

Solving a DSA problem is not about writing code immediately. It is about **thinking clearly and logically**.

### Step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the problem**

   * Read carefully
   * Identify input and output
2. **Analyze constraints**

   * Size of input
   * Time and memory limits

4. **Optimize the solution**

   * Reduce time or space complexity
5. **Dry run with examples**

 

A good problem solver spends more time **thinking than coding**.
